# SinatraApiGenerator

A ruby script that generates Sinatra Rest API's from a JSON spec.

Prerequisites: Ruby

Try running:

```ruby generate.rb example.json```

and look at the ```NEW_server.rb``` and ```NEW_Gemfile``` files it outputs.

The server should be functional, and useful for prototyping. You can then expand upon it with validation and functionality if needed!
